**Goal:**
I conduct part time Yoga classes for kids during weekends and in the evening. The goal here is to automate the process of extracting Youtube audio transcripts, summarize the transcript, identify keywords and map them to relevant yoga poses. Instead of manually reading the books, then summarizing and identifying releavnt keywords and yoga poses, I wanted to automate the entire workflow using LLM and then create a mini application which can hold a repository/curriculum. 

**Background and Rationale:**

Research has shown that introducing yoga and value education to children at an early age can have lasting effects on their physical, emotional and mental health. Yoga promotes strength, flexibility and coordination while fostering a sense of calmness. The accompanying thematic, value stories inculcate curiosity and morality. 

Thus, incorporating this into the school curriculum, school can support overall well-being and general curiosity of its young minds. 
Founded in 2021, Stretchwithsories continues to offer the program for the last three years, 80% of kids reported improved focus and flexibility and more than 60% continue since their joining. 60% have also cultivated a reading habit of stories narrated. 

**Objective:**

To introduce children to the practice of yoga in a fun, engaging and age-appropriate manner 
To promote physical fitness, body awareness and gross motor skills among learners
To teach children simple breathing exercises and relaxation techniques
To cultivate mindfulness, empathy and emotional resilience
